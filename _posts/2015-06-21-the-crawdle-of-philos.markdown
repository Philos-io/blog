Once upon a time, not that long ago, in a land where beer and chocolate reign as uncontested rulers, three tech enthusiasts decided to join forces to challenge the status quo of technology. Our quest is steep but exhilarating, we want to contribute to building tomorrow’s software by enabling our partners and our community to stay on the bleeding edge.

The times we live in are thrilling, everything moves so fast, first and foremost technology. However, this makes it also unbelievably hard for corporations and individuals to keep up with this pace. Our time and resources are limited, forcing us to make choices. Naturally, in most cases these choices goes towards focusing on customers and other revenue channels, rather than exploring and experimenting with technologies that might not even last. Yet, this restriction comes with a cost: the chance of lagging behind, the chance of waking up one day and realizing that they missed the bus.

At [Philos](https://philos.io), we want to help corporations and individuals avoid that, we want to help them **stay ahead of the game**. To do so, we created [Philos](https://philos.io) Lab. A “3.0” lab where we are constantly searching for new tools to experiment, new technologies to build with, figuring out the possibilities that software innovations can give us. We then help our partners and our community of passionate developers and disrupters learn and share skills to bring the bleeding edge technologies and methods to the next level.

After thorough experimentation, we decided to focus on Javascript Framework as our core technology for both the possibilities that it offers and its [promising future](http://www.google.be/trends/explore#q=react%20%2B%20reactjs%20%2B%20node%20%2B%20nodejs%20%2B%20angular%20%2B%20angularjs%20%2B%20meteorjs%20%2B%20javascript%20framework%20%2B%20ember%20%2B%20emberjs%20%2B%20backbonejs%2C%20php%2C%20c%23&date=1%2F2010%2065m&cmpt=q&tz=).

As a team, each of us has its field of preference. Davy, as a code lover, focuses on the technical part. Creative to the bone, Mehdi takes care of all the design part; while with his analytical skills, Max tends to focus on the business side.

The three of us have had the chance to live and work on different continents, encounter various cultures and experience different way of living. These proved enlightening and taught us that in life as in tech, experiencing and actually building or trying things yourself will teach you a lot more than just reading it in a book or on the internet. This is why we always opt for the learning by doing method. Whichever the way (conferences, workshops or bootcamp) we always strive for a hands-on and collaborative approach.







To rally other people to our cause, we united ourselves under the same blazon, Philos (φἰλος: love — passion), a name that recalls our love for the digital world and the passion that unites its community. If you too feel that you belong to that community or would like to learn more to become part of it, feel free to drop us a line via our Mail, [Twitter](https://twitter.com/philos_io) or [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/5319439), we’ll be happy to hear from you.

Happy coding!

**Philos Team**
