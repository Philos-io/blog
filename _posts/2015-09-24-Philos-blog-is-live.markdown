It's been months that we planned to move our blog to Jekyll from Medium. We haven't written much yet but our dedication
to create a dynamic community is taking over.

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a simple blog engine that transforms your plain text into static websites and blogs.

That gives us the flexibility to keep using tools like [atom](http://atom.io) to
write our blog posts. [atom](http://atom.io) has a nice Markdown **live preview**.

We spend a lot time writing code and we want to share much of our experience as we do via our conferences, technical events, bootcamps and workshops.

Stay tuned for more technical blog posts.

Happy coding!
